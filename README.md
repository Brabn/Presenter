# Presenter
Presenter for playing commercials to visitors of presentations
Based on Raspberry Pi for video and audioplayback and an Arduino controller for processing signals from sensors 

# FlowControl
The system for installation on a pipeline for liquids pumping. 

Includes fluid flow sensors, motor current sensor and control relay for online control of process parameters, logging, emergency automatic and manual control of pumping.

To process data from sensors and control the system, a separate program is used (it works on any computers with Windows OS (XP, 7, 8.10 versions)

Controller and the workplace are separated from the location of the engine and sensors at a distance of 10-20m (a standard 8-wire network cable is used to transfer all data)

## Functions
* Automatically turn on / off the engine
  - according to a given program, 
  - depending on the readings of sensors 
  - by command from a PC. 
* Data can be transferred to PC via USB cable.
* Processing data from sensors and control pump engine via desktop application (Microsoft Windows compatible) 
* Logging of process (with saving of logs and opening previously opened data)
